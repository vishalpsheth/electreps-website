## How to Replace Images

To replace any image:

1. Prepare your new image file with the same name as the one you want to replace
2. Upload the new file to this directory, overwriting the existing file
3. The website will automatically use your new image

If you want to use a different filename or add new images, you'll need to update the corresponding component files that reference these images.
